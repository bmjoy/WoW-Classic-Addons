0.3.1 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Fixed the coordinate for an ashenvale quest.
* Fixed a bug involving the total deaths list if you have a character that has the exact same number of deaths as another.
* For situations like these, it is preferable to mark them as "Never Implemented" rather than without information in ATT. That way, when the item is introduced, User Reports can be triggered to get the most accurate release date.
* The Battlegear quests are now repeatable.
* Added a quest item to AV.
* Added some random missing quest items.
* Added the Silithyst Must Flow PVP World Event.
* Added the missing AQ enchants to the Enchanting Profession section.
