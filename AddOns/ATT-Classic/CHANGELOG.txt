0.2.2 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Added the Build Tool for rapidly creating new builds.
* Appropriate auto-summarizing commit by build type.
* Cleaned up some quests in Dun Morogh. The Arena Treasure Chest is no longer listed in Rares and uses a more appropriate icon.
* Added cost for "That's Asking A Lot".
* Removed the BuffButton_OnClick override that was preventing Rogues and Druids from cancelling their stealth/form.
