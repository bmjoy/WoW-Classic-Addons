# Changelog

## v2.20

* Prepared the addon to use the threat api when available (from patch 1.13.5)
* Added an option to downscale threat to the current numbers (i.e. 1 damage = 1 threat. threat api uses 1 damage = 100 threat). Hidden until api is available.
* Removed the nameplate feature. It wasn't working correctly. Please install a dedicated nameplate addon, if you need threat colored nameplates.
* added korean and updated chinese translations
